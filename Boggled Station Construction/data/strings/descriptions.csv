astropolis_station,CUSTOM,"A colossal orbital station that rivals the famed astropoli of Mairaath. Due to concerns about history repeating itself, the station is equipped with a remotely triggered planet-killer device that can blow it into pieces too small to threaten a colony.",,,
boggled_mining_station,CUSTOM,"Purpose built to support asteroid mining operations throughout the system, this station features the high-bandwidth FTL data transmission infrastructure necessary to control vast fleets of mining drones. It also features morally flexible officials to ensure boredom does not become an impediment to productivity or employee retention.",,,
boggled_siphon_station,CUSTOM,"An orbital station that can pull volatiles into space by manipulating the magnetosphere of a nearby gas giant. The amount of volatiles the station can harvest is proportional to how abundant they are on the gas giant itself.",,,
astral_gate,CUSTOM,"These immense constructs, although visually and functionally similar to the Domain-era gates, employ a much larger version of the recall device from the Astral-class carrier to warp entire fleets from one gate to another. Due to the extreme distances involved, each astral gate features a hyperwave beacon that enables other networked gates to calibrate their recall device to target the correct space-time coordinates.",,,
gatekeeper_station,CUSTOM,"It has been said that every man lives by exchanging. Nothing makes exchanging easier than a network of gates that can transport goods and people across the Sector instantaneously. Stations located near a gate possess unrivaled accessibility and exert control over who can use the gate, but the cost of keeping the gate operational is considerable without a steady supply of Domain-era artifacts.",,,
domain_artifacts,RESOURCE,"Computing equipment and industrial machinery superior to what can currently be produced in the Sector. Useful for terraforming projects, megascale engineering and artificial intelligence research.",,,
