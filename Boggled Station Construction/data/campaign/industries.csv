ASTROPOLIS_STATION,Astropolis Station,100,180,0,0,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/astropolis_station.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Astropolis_Station,"Construct a space habitat large enough to host its own market. Due to its size and mass, it can only achieve a stable orbit around larger worlds that dominate their orbital path. Expensive to build and has no natural resources.",

Terraforming projects, megascale engineering and artificial intelligence research can still be pursued using technology available in the modern-day Sector, but at a prohibitive cost. Employing refurbished Domain-era equipment for these tasks is much more economical than using crude post-Collapse methods.",
