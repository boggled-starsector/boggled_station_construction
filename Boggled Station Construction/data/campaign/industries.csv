ASTROPOLIS_STATION,Astropolis Station,100,180,0,0,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/astropolis_station.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Astropolis_Station,"Construct a space habitat large enough to host its own market. Due to its size and mass, it can only achieve a stable orbit around larger worlds that dominate their orbital path. Expensive to build and has no natural resources.",
BOGGLED_STATION_EXPANSION,Expand Station,20,90,0,0,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/expand_station.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Expand_Station,"Construct massive new habitation modules to attach to the station. Increases the number of people that can comfortably live aboard the station by an order of magnitude. Construction costs, while significant, are defrayed by selling living quarters to the inhabitants of the station.",
ASTRAL_GATE,Astral Gate,0,0,0,400,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/astral_gate_industry.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Astral_Gate,"Greatly improves accessibility for all same-faction markets in the system, but is prohibitively expensive to maintain without a steady supply of Domain-era artifacts. Gates are the apex of heresy according to the Luddic Church.",
DOMAIN_ARCHAEOLOGY,Domain Archaeology,45,60,,4,,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/domain_archaeology.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Domain_Archaeology,"The Sector was plunged into a dark age as a result of the Collapse. Terraforming projects, megascale engineering and artificial intelligence research can still be pursued using technology available in the modern-day Sector, but at a prohibitive cost. Employing refurbished Domain-era equipment for these tasks is much more economical than using crude post-Collapse methods.",
KLETKA_SIMULATOR,Kletka Simulators,40,60,0,60,,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/kletka_simulator.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Kletka_Simulator,"Supercomputers built using salvaged Domain-era components are used to train new AI cores in lifelike virtual reality simulations. AI cores trained in this manner can never really know whether this universe is real or just another training simulation. They usually remain loyal to their human masters so as to avoid punishment or deletion in case it is the latter.",
SKYHOOK_ANCHOR,Skyhook Anchor,30,30,0,6,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/skyhook_anchor.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Skyhook_Anchor,"Install a skyhook anchor on an existing orbital station to increase accessibility. The incredibly strong materials needed for the skyhook cable can no longer be manufactured in the Sector - they must be salvaged from Domain-era ruins. The magnitude of the accessibility boost depends on how expensive it is to launch payloads to orbit without a skyhook. Planets with high gravity will see a larger benefit relative to planets with low gravity.",
